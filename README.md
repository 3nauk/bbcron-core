To Create a library as springboot project remember 

[Spring Lemon](https://github.com/naturalprogrammer/spring-lemon) would be a good example for this. 
It uses Spring Boot, and is meant to be included in other Spring Boot applications. This is what we did to create it:

- Created a Spring Boot application, using the Spring Boot Starter Wizard of STS.
- Removed the generated application and test class.
- Removed spring-boot-maven-plugin, i.e. the build and the pluginRepositories sections in pom.xml. (See how a pom.xml would look without these sections).


## Features

- Handle Page Response DTO that itÂ´ll be consumed for the controller to get the Info.
- Unified Queries and filter conditions and operations between all services
- CoreExceptions centralized
- Service for Filtering Page. Extract any filters requested by the client.
- BBCronResourceRepository to extends the MongoRepository implementation  to get the findAll 

```
  /**
   * Find All items paginated
   *
   * @param query    as {@link Query}
   * @param pageable as {@link Pageable}
   * @return result as {@link Page}
   */
  Page<T> findAll(Query query, Pageable pageable);

  /**
   * Find All items
   *
   * @param query as {@link Query}
   * @return result as {@link List<T>}
   */
  List<T> findAll(Query query);
```
